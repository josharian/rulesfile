This is a language extension for VSCode for the .rules files used in the Go compiler.

I'm not bothering to publish it properly, since there are probably about three people on the planet who care about it.

To install, clone/download and put into
the `<user home>/.vscode/extensions` folder and restart Code.

This installs the language support. Most themes won't do much highlighting of the scopes this extension generates: probably just comments and some "keywords" like `&&` and `->`.

If you want to further tweak the appearance, add stuff like this to your `settings.json`:

```json
"editor.tokenColorCustomizations": {
    "textMateRules": [
        {
            "scope": "keyword.operator.atblock.gorules",
            "settings": {
                "foreground": "#68e968",
                "fontStyle": ""
            }
        },
        {
            "scope": "entity.name.variable.gorules",
            "settings": {
                "foreground": "#e7d531"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

Scopes generated by this language extension are:

* `comment.line.double-slash.gorules`
* `entity.name.aux.gorules`
* `entity.name.auxint.gorules`
* `entity.name.type.gorules`
* `entity.name.variable.gorules`
* `keyword.operator.andand.gorules`
* `keyword.operator.arrow.gorules`
* `keyword.operator.atblock.gorules`
* `keyword.operator.ellipsis.gorules`
* `string.quoted.double.gorules`
